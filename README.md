# pbpy
Pitch playing robot pb ported to python.

...at least it will be once the actual game is complete.

Just run main.py in Python 3 to start a new two-player game against the bot.

Currently the bot always passes its bid and always plays the first card in its hand (even if it isn't a valid playable card...)

The goal is to eventually port to a web hosted pitch game playable in browser, specialized for bot creation/statistic tracking.
